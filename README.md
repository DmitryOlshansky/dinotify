dinotify
========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DmitryOlshansky/dinotify.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DmitryOlshansky/dinotify)

A tiny D library to work with Linux's kernel inotify file events subsystem.

Compared to other solutions it doesn't try to be cross-platform and
pretend to abstract away inotify-specific quirks.

For cross-platform library, see [FSWatch](https://github.com/WebFreak001/FSWatch).
